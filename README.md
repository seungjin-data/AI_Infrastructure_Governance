# Governing AI Infrastructure Expansion

**Governance architecture, risk redistribution, and policy responses across 25 jurisdictions (2019–2026)**

Submitted to *Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions* (EIST)

---

## Overview

This repository contains the complete dataset and replication materials for the above-titled manuscript. The study constructs and analyzes a manually verified database of **144 policy events** across **25 governance entities** (24 national-level jurisdictions and the EU) and 32 subnational jurisdictions (2019–2026), examining the relationship between governance architecture and risk redistribution in AI-driven data center infrastructure expansion.

## Key Findings

- **χ²(4, N = 144) = 131.79, p < .001; Cramér's V = 0.676**
- Constraint measures → Spatial redistribution (88.4%)
- Facilitation measures → Sectoral redistribution (86.5%)
- Steering measures → Temporal redistribution (56.2%)
- Sensitivity analysis excluding non-enacted events (N=121): V = 0.681 (direction unchanged)

## Reproduction Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Required packages: `pandas`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/AI_Infrastructure_Governance_EIST.git
cd AI_Infrastructure_Governance_EIST
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
python code/analysis_main.py
```

All reported tables (1–4), Figure 1, and the sensitivity analysis will be regenerated automatically in the `outputs/` directory.

### Expected Output

```
Chi-square: chi2(4, N = 144) = 131.79, p < .001
Cramers V: 0.676
Sensitivity (enacted only, N = 121): V = 0.681
```

## Dataset Description

### work_db_v5_EIST_FINAL.csv

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Event_ID | Unique identifier (V-001 to V-144) |
| Year | Year of policy event (2019–2026) |
| Month | Month of policy event |
| Jurisdiction | Jurisdiction name |
| Level | Governance level (National / Subnational / Supranational) |
| Policy_Type | Specific policy instrument type |
| Description | Brief event description |
| Source | Primary source name |
| Source_URL | URL of primary source documentation |
| Verification_Status | Verification outcome (Verified) |
| Macro_Category | Policy macro-category (6 types) |
| Redistribution_Type | Risk redistribution dimension (Spatial / Sectoral / Temporal) |
| Gov_Architecture | Governance architecture (Constraint / Facilitation / Steering) |

### coding_log_v5.csv

Records the primary-source textual clause supporting each `Redistribution_Type` and `Gov_Architecture` assignment. Each coding decision follows a single-decision rule based on the dominant regulatory mechanism explicitly enacted in the policy instrument.
